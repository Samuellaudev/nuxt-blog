# Personal Website V2 ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

Hello! This is my second portfolio website that I built using the @nuxt/content module of Nuxt2, the framework language that the company I worked for was using. While some people may think it's overkill to use it for a personal website, I consider it a valuable opportunity to expand my existing knowledge by creating interesting projects!

## Getting started
```
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
npm run build
npm run start
```
